# Portfolio - Berkan Hergul

Welcome to my portfolio website, In this project I want to show the projects I have worked on at my study majoring in Media Design.

# How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript.

# Concept
The concept of my portfolio website was to create a retro vibe website where users can see the projects I have worked on, before I started i wanted to create a minimalistic modern website but I completely scrapped this idea because I wanted to add my own personality in this website.

# About Me
My name is Berkan Hergul, I am based in The Netherlands and I am 20 years of age. I love to create creative ideas and visual works, I tried to make that work with this portfolio website.
