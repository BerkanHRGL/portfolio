  <h3>MY EVIDENCE</h3>
  <p>When I work on projects, I always want to test my ideas with real people to see if they actually work. I think this is really important because you can't know if something is good until you try it with users. Let me show you how I do this in my work:</p>
  <div class="evidence-item">
  <h4>User Testing in the Cardan UX Project</h4>
  <p>For the Cardan project, I wanted to make sure our visual impairment simulations were actually helpful for people. I made interactive prototypes and asked users to try them out. I paid attention to their feedback and changed things based on what they told me.</p>
  <p>When users said my first maze idea wasn't realistic enough, I listened and made it better. I changed it to show real everyday situations instead, which worked much better for teaching people about accessibility problems.</p>

  <h4>A/B Testing for Portfolio Design</h4>
  <p>When I was working on my portfolio, I wasn't sure which navigation style would work better. So I made two different versions and tested them with users. One had text buttons and one had retro-style icons.</p>
  <p>Most users liked the retro icons better because they looked more interesting and fit with the whole design. I'm glad I tested this instead of just guessing, because now I know the portfolio works better for people who visit it.</p>

  <h4>Interactive Prototyping for Boris Schmidt's Brand</h4>
  <p>For the Boris Schmidt branding project, I made surveys to test different poster designs with people who like techno music. I wanted to make sure the designs actually communicated the right feeling for his music.</p>
  <p>The survey results helped me understand that people preferred designs that mixed abstract and organic shapes. This feedback directly changed how I made the final brand design.</p>

  <h4>Development of Accessibility Simulations</h4>
  <p>I think the best example of my interactive media work is the accessibility simulations I made for Cardan. I created web games that let people experience what it's like to have visual impairments.</p>
  <p>After testing showed my first maze game wasn't realistic enough, I completely redesigned it to focus on everyday situations. When I tested the final version with college students, they gave it an average realism score of 8.8/10. This made me really happy because it showed the simulation actually worked as an educational tool.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="evidence-item">
  <h4>Working with Stakeholder Feedback</h4>
  <p>When I presented our simulations to Carolina from Cardan, she gave me important feedback. She said users should actively do something in the simulation instead of just watching passively.</p>
  <p>I took this feedback seriously and created the interactive fashion game where users make outfits while experiencing visual impairments. This shows that I can change my designs based on what stakeholders need.</p>

  <h4>Petchi App: Creating Emotional Connection Through Interaction</h4>
  <p>My biggest interactive media project was building Petchi, a goal-tracking app that combines productivity with emotional connection through a virtual pet. The whole concept was about making task management more engaging by creating a real emotional bond between users and their digital pet.</p>
  <p>What made this interactive was testing different ways to make the pet feel alive and responsive. I user tested several friends to see if they actually cared about their pet's happiness when completing goals. The feedback was really good, people immediately understood the concept and found the pet character appealing. The main insight was that users wanted completed goals to disappear rather than just being crossed out, which I implemented right away.</p>

  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p>Through these projects, I've learned that creating interactive media isn't just about making something that works - it's about making something that actually helps people. I always test my ideas with users and change them based on feedback. This way of working has helped me create better products that people actually want to use.</p>

<div class="learning-outcome-description">
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> You explore front-end development languages, you write code and document in a version control environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="learning-outcome-evidence">
  <h3>MY EVIDENCE</h3>
  <p>I really enjoy coding and learning new ways to build things. When I work on projects, I always try to understand how the code works instead of just copying things. I also make sure to keep track of my work using version control. Here's how I've been learning and improving:</p>
  <div class="evidence-item">
  <h4>Portfolio Website Development</h4>
  <p>Building this portfolio website was my biggest coding challenge so far. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create everything you see - the retro boot screen, the draggable windows, and all the interactive parts.</p>
  <p>The hardest part was making the window system work properly. I had to figure out how to make windows draggable, manage which one is active, and get all the visual effects working. It took me some time to understand, but I'm really proud of how it works now.</p>

  <div class="evidence-item">
  <h4>Visual Impairment Simulation Games</h4>
  <p>For the Cardan project, I made three different web games that simulate visual impairments. I focused on the blurry vision simulation, where I had to create realistic blur effects using CSS and JavaScript.</p>
  <p>The tricky part was making the blur effects look real while keeping the game playable. I tried different CSS filter values and JavaScript events to create scenarios like reading bus schedules or finding alarm clocks when everything is blurry.</p>

  <div class="evidence-item">
  <h4>Using Version Control Properly</h4>
  <p>I've learned to use both GitHub and GitLab for my projects. At first I didn't understand why version control was important, but now I can't imagine working without Git. It helps me keep track of changes and work together with teammates without problems.</p>
  <p>For my portfolio, I used GitHub Desktop to manage all my commits. In the Cardan development project, our team used GitLab and we organized our code so everyone had their own CSS file. We made sure to commit changes regularly and write clear messages about what we changed.</p>

  <div class="evidence-item">
  <h4>Learning New Technologies</h4>
  <p>In my projects, I often need to learn new coding techniques. When I don't understand something, I use GitHub Copilot as a learning tool - but I don't just copy the code. I ask it to explain how things work so I can actually understand the logic.</p>
  <p>This way of learning has helped me understand new JavaScript techniques, especially for handling image filters, click events, and working with the DOM. I can honestly say I understand how my code works instead of just making things that seem to work.</p>

  <h4>Building Petchi: Full-Stack Goal Tracking App</h4>
  <p>Petchi was my most challenging development project so far. I built a complete goal-tracking web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where users can create goals and watch their virtual pet's mood change based on their completion rate. The trickiest part was getting the localStorage to work properly and making sure the pet's mood updates felt natural and immediate.</p>
  <p>I learned a lot about mobile-first design during this project. Getting the touch interactions right and preventing weird zoom behaviors took some time to figure out. I also implemented PWA features so users can install Petchi on their home screen like a real app. The pet mood system was probably the most fun to code - I had to calculate completion percentages and smoothly transition between different pet expressions.</p>

  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p>My development work has grown from basic HTML and CSS to building interactive applications. I try to understand what I am building instead of just making things work. Using version control has become normal for me, I use it to track my work, work with others, and keep my code organized so other people can understand it too.</p>
<p>I still need to work on writing better tests for my code and improving my debugging skills. Sometimes I spend too much time on small details instead of focusing on the bigger picture.</p>

      <h2>LEARNING OUTCOME: DESIGN</h2>
<div class="learning-outcome-description">
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> You explore and use professional design tools and you iteratively design visual works.</p>
</div>

<div class="learning-outcome-evidence">
  <h3>MY EVIDENCE</h3>
  <p>Throughout my projects, I've consistently used professional design tools and followed iterative design processes to create visual works. Let me show you how I've developed my design skills and workflow:</p>
  
  <div class="evidence-item">
    <h4>Complete Brand Identity Design for Boris Schmidt</h4>
    <p>TDuring the Boris Schmidt branding project, I worked on creating a complete visual identity from the ground up. I used Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop to explore different design directions. The process started with mood boards and style scapes to define the visual tone. From there, I developed and refined multiple logo concepts while documenting each step to reflect on what worked and what could be improved.</p>
    <p>Throughout the project, I continuously iterated based on feedback. I explored at least 14 different logo directions, experimenting with glitch effects, gothic typography, and various visual elements, before finding the right balance between techno energy and natural influences that aligned with Boris' vision.</p>

  <div class="evidence-item">
    <h4>UX Design and Wireframing for Cardan</h4>
    <p>For the Cardan accessibility project, I worked in Figma to design wireframes and prototypes with accessibility in mind from the start. This project was not just about making something look good, but about making sure every part worked well for people with visual impairments. I started with simple wireframes to set up the structure, then focused on designs with correct heading levels and clear focus indicators.</p>
    <p>Throughout the project, I tested and improved the designs based on feedback. I looked at what worked well and what needed changes. In the final version, the high-fidelity prototypes showed that good visual design and accessibility can go hand in hand. This project helped me understand how to create designs that are both clear and inclusive.</p>

    <h4>Portfolio Design and Visual Identity</h4>
    <p>Creating this portfolio was a chance to really showcase my personal design style. I designed everything from scratch in Photoshop and Figma - the retro pixel art, the custom logo, the window interface design, and all the visual elements you see.</p>
    <p>The design went through multiple iterations based on user testing. I conducted A/B tests to determine which navigation style worked better, and did 5-second tests to make sure the visual hierarchy was clear. Each round of feedback helped me refine the design further.</p>

    <h4>Iterative Design Process and Tools</h4>
    <p>Across all my projects, you can see how I've developed a solid iterative design process. I always start with research and mood boards, move through multiple concept variations, test with users, and refine based on feedback. It's become a habit for me to create multiple versions and not get attached to the first idea.</p>
    <p>I've also become proficient with tools like Photoshop, Illustrator and Figma. Each tool has its own strengths</p>

    <h4>Visual Research and Concept Development</h4>
    <p>I've learned that good design starts with good research. For every project, I spend time understanding the target audience, analyzing competitors, and creating mood boards that capture the right feeling before I start designing.</p>
    <p>The Boris Schmidt project is a perfect example - I interviewed techno fans, researched the music scene, and created detailed personas before designing anything. This research foundation made all the difference in creating a brand that actually resonated with the target audience.</p>

    <h4>Petchi Character Design and Visual Identity</h4>
    <p>When I was creating Petchi, I wanted the character to feel friendly and approachable without being too childish. I designed the pet character in Adobe Illustrator, going through several iterations to find the right balance. The character needed to work across different mood states: happy, neutral, and sad, while staying recognizable and appealing.</p>
    <p>I chose a hamster-like design because it feels friendly and the round, simple shapes work well at small sizes and are easy to animate with CSS. I went through multiple concepts before finding the right style that worked both functionally and emotionally. The iterative process really helped me understand how small design changes can have a big impact on user connection.</p>

  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p>My design work has grown over time from learning basic tools to working on visual problems. I have learned to use design tools and built a work process that helps me get good results.</p>
  <p>I still need to work on expanding my skills with 3D design tools like Blender and learning more about motion graphics for backgrounds. Sometimes I rely too much on the same design patterns instead of trying new approaches. I also want to get better at user research and testing my designs with real users to make sure they work well for everyone.</p>

  <h3>MY EVIDENCE</h3>
  <p>Throughout my projects, I've consistently demonstrated professional standards in how I organize work, communicate with clients and teammates, conduct research, and present results. Here's how I've applied these practices:</p>
  
  <div class="evidence-item">
    <h4>Client Communication and Stakeholder Management</h4>
    <p>Working with Boris Schmidt for the branding project taught me how to communicate professionally with real clients. I conducted interviews to understand his vision, presented concepts clearly, and incorporated his feedback into the design process. The final presentation at Rock Academy was a formal client delivery where I presented the content strategy section professionally.</p>
    <p>For the Cardan project, I learned how to present to corporate stakeholders. When Carolina gave us feedback that our simulation needed more interactivity, I took that input seriously and redesigned the concept to meet her requirements - showing I can adapt professionally when client needs change.</p>
    <button class="evidence-button" data-project="ux" data-section="presenting">VIEW CLIENT PRESENTATIONS</button>
  </div>
  
  <div class="evidence-item">
    <h4>Team Project Organization and Collaboration</h4>
    <p>The Cardan development project was my biggest team collaboration challenge. We set up clear communication channels using Discord with different channels for different types of discussions. I helped create weekly planning schedules where we divided tasks fairly and everyone could choose what they wanted to work on.</p>
    <p>What made this work was our clear task division and regular check-ins. Everyone knew their responsibilities, and we used version control properly so we could work together without stepping on each other's code. It felt like a real professional development team.</p>
    <button class="evidence-button" data-project="ux" data-section="planning">VIEW TEAM ORGANIZATION</button>
  </div>
  
  <div class="evidence-item">
    <h4>Comprehensive Research and Documentation</h4>
    <p>I've learned to conduct thorough exploratory research before starting any project. For the Cardan accessibility project, I researched digital accessibility standards, analyzed competitor approaches, and studied the specific challenges faced by visually impaired users. This wasn't just surface-level research - I dug into WCAG guidelines and real user needs.</p>
    <p>For Boris Schmidt, I conducted target audience interviews and created detailed personas based on real data. I documented everything properly so the research could inform design decisions throughout the project. Good research documentation has become a cornerstone of how I approach projects.</p>

  </div>
  
  <div class="evidence-item">
    <h4>Professional Reporting and Presentation</h4>
    <p>I've developed strong skills in creating professional presentations and reports. For each project, I created comprehensive documentation that explained not just what I designed, but why I made those decisions and how they solved the client's problems.</p>
    <p>My user testing reports include proper methodology, clear findings, and recommendations. When I present to clients or classmates, I structure my presentations logically and focus on the value I'm delivering rather than just showing pretty pictures.</p>

    <h4>Project Planning and Time Management</h4>
    <p>I've learned to break down complex projects into manageable phases with clear deliverables. Whether working alone or in teams, I create realistic timelines and stick to them. For the portfolio project, I planned everything from initial research through final development, making sure each phase built logically on the previous one.</p>
    <p>When working in teams, I contribute to project planning and make sure everyone understands the timeline and their role in meeting deadlines. I've learned that good project organization is what separates professional work from student work.</p>

  <div class="evidence-item">
    <h4>Petchi App: Complete Project Documentation and Research</h4>
    <p>When I was developing Petchi, I made sure to document everything properly from the beginning. I started with comprehensive research about existing productivity and pet apps, analyzing competitors like Habitica, Forest, and Tamagotchi-style games to understand what works and what doesn't. I documented this field research thoroughly, identifying the gap between emotionally engaging apps and genuinely productive ones.</p>
    <p>I also conducted proper user testing with several friends, documenting their feedback. Most users immediately understood the concept and found the pet character appealing, but the main insight was that users wanted completed goals to disappear rather than just being crossed out. I implemented this feedback professionally and documented the changes, showing how user research directly influenced the final product.</p>

  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p>Working on these projects has taught me that professional standards are not just about making good work, they are about how you organize, communicate, and work together throughout the whole process. I have learned to approach every project with proper planning, clear communication, and good documentation.</p>
  <p>Whether I am working with external clients like Boris Schmidt and Cardan, or working with classmates on team projects, I use professional practices that help projects run smoothly and deliver real value.</p>
  <p>I still need to work on managing my time better when projects get complex and learning to get more feedback during the design process. Sometimes I focus too much on perfectionism instead of delivering work on time.</p>

  <h3>MY EVIDENCE</h3>
  <p>When I work on a project (individually or in a group),I take notes of the feedback to reflect as well as possible so that the work (work attitude, planning, etc.) is improved. I usually process feedback from both teachers and test results immediately, this is reflected in my work.</p>
  
  <div class="evidence-item">
    <h4>Taking Initiative in Feedback and Reflection</h4>
    <p>Besides showing initiative for feedback and reflections, I also do this for other things such as: presenting, documenting or taking on important tasks. When an important assignment needs to be carried out, I like to be directly involved in this, or at least be aware of how this is being carried out. I am always aware of deadlines and want to have my/our work submitted on time and well.</p>
    <p>For my portfolio, I conducted 5-second tests and A/B testing with multiple users to understand what was working and what wasn't. When users told me my navigation wasn't clear enough, I didn't get defensive, I took that feedback and improved the design immediately.</p>
