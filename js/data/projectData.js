      <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p>In this project I had to create a complete visual look for a techno artist named Boris Schmidt. I worked with my team to make visual designs that matched his music style and personality. My goal was to build a unique and easy-to-remember visual brand that would represent Boris Schmidt well.</p>

        <h2>RESEARCH PROCESS</h2>
        <p>I started by studying the techno music scene and Boris Schmidt's music style. I looked at what other techno artists were doing and created mood boards to gather ideas. I interviewed Boris to learn what he wanted for his brand, and also talked to a techno music fan to understand what the audience likes. Using what I learned from these interviews and creating a user persona, I designed visuals that truly represent Boris as an artist. My goal was to create a brand that both Boris and his fans would connect with.</p>
        
        <h3>INTERVIEW</h3>
        <p>I interviewed Sophie, a 20-year-old techno fan, to better understand the target audience. She listens to melodic and minimal techno, especially artists like Tale of Us and Mind Against. Sophie uses techno music to relax and create a certain mood. She prefers festivals with a relaxed atmosphere and pays attention to album covers when choosing music.</p>
        <p>The interview helped me understand that techno fans like Sophie want more than just hard beats - they want atmosphere, emotion, and beautiful visuals. This insight shaped how I designed Boris Schmidt's brand to appeal to this audience.</p>

          <div class="persona-text">
            <p>Based on my interview with Sophie, I created this persona that represents the target audience for Boris Schmidt's brand. This persona helps me understand who I'm designing for and what they really want.</p>
            <p>This persona helps me make better design choices because I know exactly what the target audience wants. It shows me that I need to focus on beautiful visuals and make sure the brand works well on social media platforms.</p>

          <div class="survey-text">
            <p>I conducted an A/B test survey with 12 participants to test two different poster designs for Boris Schmidt. The survey helped me understand which design better communicates energy and mystery to the target audience.</p>
            <p>The results showed that Version 2 was preferred because it felt more mysterious and creative. People said Version 1 looked too direct and normal, while Version 2 created intrigue with its abstract design and hidden elements. This confirmed that the mysterious approach I chose for Boris Schmidt's brand appeals more to the target audience than straightforward designs.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>CONTENT STRATEGY</h3>
        <p>I created this content strategy because it's important to present the brand in a consistent way. With a clear strategy, I know what tone, style, and type of content we should use to reach the right target audience. It helps me convey the message effectively and increase brand visibility.</p>

            <p>As a first step, we made a moodboard together. This helped us see what style and feeling we wanted for the brand. It gave us a clear direction and helped us check if Boris liked our ideas.</p>
            <p>I picked these images because they capture exactly what Boris wanted, a mysterious vibe with a strong connection to nature. The dark forest photos and abstract patterns create that mysterious feeling he was looking for. The nature images were important because Boris wanted to show his connection to the natural world, not just the club scene. The green lights and black-and-white visuals bring in the techno energy while keeping that mysterious atmosphere. For the typography, I chose bold, technical fonts that look both modern and industrial, matching the techno music style.</p>

        <h2>RESEARCH PROCESS</h2>
        <p>I conducted comprehensive research to understand the current state of digital accessibility and the specific challenges faced by visually impaired users. The research focused on three key areas: competitive analysis of existing accessibility solutions, understanding visual impairments and their impact on web usage, and identifying the target audience within government institutions.</p>
        
        <p>Through literature research and case study analysis, I discovered that many websites still fail to meet basic accessibility standards. For example, only 23% of Dutch municipal websites comply with established accessibility guidelines, highlighting the urgent need for better accessibility solutions.</p>

<p>The left side shows the first wireframe my classmate worked on, based on an initial design I created. This wireframe established the basic structure and layout for accessible web interfaces. On this design, my classmate applied visual impairment simulations including tunnel vision, blurry vision, and central vision loss to create examples of how people with those visual impairments engage with digital accessibility. This approach helped us understand the real problems users face.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
<h3>WEBSITE FINAL PROTOTYPE</h3>
<p>We designed a website that serves as a simulation tool. The concept is to integrate templates that mimic visual impairments into this website.</p>

<div class="prototype-full-image">
  <img src="imgs/maison.png" alt="Maison de Couture Prototype" class="clickable-image">
</div>

<p>I came up with the initial concept called "maison de couture" - an online fashion magazine specifically developed for Cardan's simulation. After developing the concept, I created the initial design for a 'game' that users can interact with within the simulation.</p>

<p>The game within the simulation involves creating an outfit. I designed the initial prototype and concept using Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Figma. My teammate then further developed and refined this design into three functional pages, where users can: choose a model, select clothing items, and swap clothes or change colors.</p>

<p>When the simulation starts, the goal is to put together an outfit while experiencing the challenges of a visual impairment. The templates provide a realistic experience of visual limitations. Beyond being a digital experience, the game also gives users insight into what it's like for someone with, for example, color blindness to choose an outfit. This creates a connection to physical reality as well.</p>

<div class="presenting-section">
  <h2>PRESENTING</h2>
  <p>We prepared a presentation for our meeting with Carolina from Cardan. During this session, we showcased our research findings, the "maison de couture" simulation concept, and demonstrated how our visual impairment templates provide users with realistic accessibility experiences.</p>
    <div class="presentation-image">
    <img src="imgs/presentatie-cardan.png" alt="Cardan Accessibility Presentation" class="clickable-image">
  </div>
  
<p>We explained our design process and how the fashion magazine simulation helps users understand the daily problems that people with visual impairments face. Carolina and the Cardan team liked our approach and thought it was a good way to teach people about accessibility through real-life situations.</p>
  <h3>FEEDBACK AND ITERATIONS</h3>
<p>After the presentation, Carolina and our teachers Frank and Anke gave us helpful feedback. A classmate wrote down their suggestions to understand what we did well and what we needed to improve.</p>

<p>Carolina's feedback was really important for creating the outfit game. She wanted users to actually do something in the simulation, not just look at it. This is why I made the interactive fashion game where people can create outfits while experiencing visual problems.</p>

<h3>FINAL PRESENTATION</h3>
<p>In our final presentation, we showed how we added the outfit game to the fashion magazine design. We showed the complete simulation where users can experience different visual impairments while trying to pick outfits and use the magazine website.</p>

<p>We made the outfit game because of the feedback we got in our first presentation. Carolina asked for something interactive, so we created this fun feature that makes users actually do things instead of just looking at the simulation.</p>

        <h2>RESEARCH PROGRESS</h2>     
        <p>The concept we developed into a digital (impairment) simulation for Cardan's website consists of three games. We came up with three different games, each containing a different simulation for a visual impairment: 'tunnel vision', 'blurry vision', and 'central vision loss'.</p>
        
        <p>We recreated a Cardan page where we integrated a choice menu for the three simulations (games). Since our project group consisted of three people, the task division was quickly made and the different visual impairment types were divided. We then individually came up with a matching game that we also individually developed into a new prototype in Figma and into a working website in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
        
        <h3>My Simulation Concept</h3>
        <p>I chose the type: blurry vision. My concept development went through several iterations to create the most effective simulation for understanding the challenges of blurry vision in everyday situations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>First Concept:</strong> I created a blurry maze game where users needed to navigate out of a maze while experiencing blurred vision. The game included a slider that allowed users to adjust the level of blurriness to understand different degrees of visual impairment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Second Concept:</strong> I developed a menu reading quiz game where users had to read a blurry restaurant menu card and answer questions about it. This simulated the real-world challenge of reading text with blurry vision, making it a practical learning experience.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Final Concept "Blurred":</strong> After testing both concepts, I combined the best elements to create my final game. The concept involves showing users blurry images of everyday scenarios with tasks like "Where is the alarm clock?" that they need to shut down. This game effectively demonstrates how blurry vision affects daily activities and decision-making, providing valuable insight into the real challenges people with visual impairments face.</p>
        
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>A choice page for the simulations is created. Here three simulations are displayed for the three types of visual impairment. Each simulation consists of a game, in which the user experiences the impairment as realistically as possible through hindering elements.</p>

            <p>The results were really good! Everyone finished the game and said it felt realistic (average score 8.8/10). The transport scene with the buses was the hardest for everyone. People got frustrated at first but understood better by the end how hard daily tasks can be with vision problems.</p>
            
            <p>All users started clicking randomly but learned to be more careful as they played. The game took about 1-2 minutes to complete, and everyone said the difficulty was just right, challenging but not impossible.</p>

        <div class="mockups-text">
          <p>I started my design process by creating wireframes and prototypes in Figma. My first concept was a simple maze game where users had to navigate through a blurry maze to test how they deal with unclear vision.</p>
          
          <p>After testing the maze concept, I realized people wanted something more realistic and relatable to daily life. So I moved on to designing a restaurant menu game where users had to read blurry menu items and answer questions about them. For this concept, I used Adobe Illustrator to create detailed menu layouts with different food items and prices.</p>
          
          <p>The maze design used simple geometric shapes that I created directly in Figma, while the restaurant game needed more polished graphics which is why I switched to Illustrator for that part.</p>
          
  <p>Through user feedback, I learned that people wanted both the challenge aspect of the maze and the real-world connection of the restaurant game. This led me to develop my final concept that combined everyday scenarios with interactive challenges, creating a more complete learning experience about living with blurry vision.</p>

      <div class="presentation-section">
        <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <p>Most of the project was about building the simulations with code. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the interactive game. The biggest challenge was making the blur effects work properly and creating smooth user interactions.</p>
        
        <p>For parts I didn't understand yet, I used GitHub Copilot as a learning tool. Instead of just copying code, I asked it to explain how things worked so I could understand the logic behind it. This helped me learn new Javascript techniques, especially for handling image filters and click events.</p>
        
        <p>The game tracks user clicks, measures time for each scenario, and gives feedback based on their choices. All the blur effects are created using CSS filters, and Javascript handles the game logic and user interactions.</p>

          <div class="version-control-text">
            <p>After finishing the prototype in Figma, we created a shared GitLab repository to start coding the game together. We used GitLab instead of GitHub because that was the preference of the teammate who set up the repository.</p>
            
            <p>Through GitLab we could work together on the code without problems. We organized our project with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for each team member, so we couldn't interfere with each other's work. Each person had their own CSS file to avoid conflicts.</p>
            
            <p>We made sure to commit all our changes regularly and kept the GitLab repository well organized with clear commit messages. This made it easy to track progress and collaborate effectively as a team.</p>

      <h2>RESEARCH PROGRESS</h2>
      <p>For my portfolio website I got inspiration from many other websites. I looked closely at what they did well, but also what didn't work so great. By comparing them, I got a better idea of what I wanted to make, and especially what I didn't want.</p>
      
      <p>Some sites looked very clean and neat, but felt a bit boring or impersonal. Others were very creative and playful, but sometimes messy or unclear. By looking at all of this, I knew better which direction I wanted to go.</p>
      
      <p>I wanted to make something that really fits me, something that shows my style and feels personal. By learning from other websites I could make better choices and finally ended up with a design that I'm really happy with.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="moodboard-text">
          <p>The first one caught my eye because it's super clean and easy to read, nothing fancy but it works really well. The second one showed me how you can add your personality to a website without making it look unprofessional.</p>

  <h2>5 SECOND TEST</h2>
  
  <div class="mockups-text">
    <p>I wanted to make sure my portfolio actually works before showing it to others. So I did a 5-second test with three people to see what they noticed right away and if they understood what my website was about.</p>
    
    <p>The good news is that everyone immediately caught the retro style and thought it looked creative and unique. They all remembered my name, that I'm a media design student, and that I'm from the Netherlands. Meaning the visual style was good.</p>
    
    <p>But here's what didn't work so well: people weren't sure exactly what kind of design work I do. Some wondered if I focus on websites, visual design, or something else. A few also mentioned they weren't sure where to click or what they were supposed to do on the site.</p>
    
    <p>So the takeaway is pretty clear, my portfolio grabs attention with its style, but I need to make it clearer what I actually do and guide visitors better on how to navigate the site.</p>

  <h2>A/B TEST</h2>
  
  <div class="mockups-text">
    <p>After the 5-second test, I wanted to figure out which navigation style would work best for my portfolio. So I created two versions of my homepage to compare, version A had simple text buttons at the bottom, and version B used retro icons that really stood out.</p>
    
    <p>I was curious to see which one people would find easier to understand and use. Would they prefer the clean, simple text buttons or the more visual retro icons that matched my website's style?</p>
    
    <p>The results were pretty interesting! Two out of three people preferred version B with the retro icons. They said the icons immediately caught their attention and made navigation much easier to find. The visual style also felt more alive and fit better with the rest of the website.</p>
    
    <p>One person did prefer version A though, saying the text buttons were clearer and less overwhelming. They found the icons a bit too big and sometimes confusing.</p>
    
    <p>In the end, most people liked the retro icons better because they made the site more visually appealing and the navigation was clearer. So I decided to go with version B for my final design.</p>

      <p>I made my portfolio logo to match the retro gaming vibe I was going for. I wanted something that felt personal but also looked professional at the same time.</p>
      <p>I created it in Photoshop first, trying out different ideas and fonts until I found something that clicked. Then I brought it into Figma to clean it up and make sure it worked well with the rest of my design.</p>

      <p>All the pixel art icons and graphics were made from scratch to get that authentic retro look. I spent time making sure each pixel was in the right place so everything looked consistent.</p>
      <p>I designed them in Photoshop pixel by pixel, then imported everything into Figma to organize and implement in my design. It was pretty time-consuming but totally worth it for the final result.</p>
    </div>

<div class="presentation-section">
  <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
  <p>Building this portfolio was the fun part where I got to bring all my designs to life with code. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the interactive retro experience you're seeing right now.</p>
  
  <p>The trickiest part was definitely getting all the window interactions working properly. Making windows draggable, managing which one is active, and getting the blur effects right took some time to figure out. I also spent a lot of effort making sure the pixel art elements stayed crisp and the retro button effects felt authentic.</p>
  
  <p>I used GitHub Copilot to help me with some of the more complex JavaScript functions, especially the window management system. It was really helpful for explaining how certain code worked so I could understand it better instead of just copying it.</p>
  
  <p>The typing animation on the login screen and the boot sequence were probably my favorite parts to code. Getting the timing right and making it feel like an old computer starting up was really satisfying.</p>

    <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>Petchi is a goal-tracking web app I developed that combines productivity with emotional connection through a virtual pet. The concept is simple but powerful, the better you complete your daily goals, the happier your pet becomes. This approach makes task management more engaging and personally meaningful.</p>

    <div class="research-section">
      <h2>RESEARCH PROCESS</h2>
      <p>My research started by exploring existing productivity and pet apps to understand what works and what doesn't. I looked at apps like Habitica, Forest, and various Tamagotchi-style games to see how they create emotional attachment and maintain user engagement.</p>
      
      <p>What I found interesting is that most productivity apps either felt too serious and boring, or too gamified and childish. I wanted to find that sweet spot where the pet feels genuine and the productivity aspect actually helps people build better habits.</p>
      
      <h3>FIELD RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>I analyzed 4 existing productivity apps (Finch, Habitica, Todoist, Apple Reminders) to identify market gaps. While most apps have good interfaces and organization features, they either lack emotional engagement (Todoist, Apple Reminders) or focus too much on gaming rather than actual productivity (Finch, Habitica).</p>
      
      <p>This research revealed an opportunity to create a simple goal-tracking app that combines emotional connection through a virtual pet with practical productivity features, where the pet's mood directly reflects real task completion.</p>
      
      <p>There's a gap between emotionally engaging apps and genuinely productive ones, my app concept fills this gap by making the pet's happiness directly tied to actual goal completion rather than separate game mechanics.</p>

      <p>I did user testing with several friends to validate the concept and identify usability issues. The testing focused on the onboarding flow, daily usage patterns, and emotional connection with the pet.</p>
      
      <p>Most users immediately understood the concept and found the pet character appealing. The onboarding process worked smoothly, and people enjoyed the personalization aspect of naming both themselves and their pet.</p>
      
      <p>The main feedback was about goal management, users wanted completed goals to disappear from the list rather than just being crossed out, which led me to implement the disappearing task feature. People also appreciated the immediate mood feedback when completing or adding goals.</p>

      <h2>DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
      <p>I started the design process by sketching different concepts for how the pet and goals would interact. The biggest question was how to make the pet feel alive and responsive without being distracting from the actual productivity aspect.</p>

          <p>I designed the pet character in Adobe Illustrator, going through several iterations to find the right balance between cute and professional. The character needed to work across different mood states: happy, neutral, and sad while staying recognizable and appealing.</p>
          <p>I chose a hamster-like design because it feels friendly and approachable without being too childish. The round, simple shapes also work well at small sizes and are easy to animate with CSS.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

    <div class="development-section">
  <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
  <p>Building Petchi was a challenging coding project. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the interactive pet experience and goal tracking system. The trickiest part was getting the localStorage to work properly and making sure the pet's mood updates felt natural and immediate.</p>
  
  <p>I learned a lot about mobile-first design and making sure the app works perfectly on phones. Getting the touch interactions right and preventing weird zoom behaviors took some time. I also implemented PWA features so users can install Petchi on their home screen like a real app.</p>
  
  <p>The pet mood system was probably the most fun to code. I had to calculate completion percentages and smoothly transition between different pet expressions. Making the pet feel alive and responsive to user actions was really satisfying when I finally got it working.</p>
